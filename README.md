# My Python Lambda Layers
This repo is meant to be the source of truth and code to build AWS lambda Layers for my personal project. I've kept these Lambda Layers public for those of who want to try and use them to run my projects locally. But be warned they might not always be public, so I would suggest if you are trying to build a AWS Lambda app, you build your own layers.
